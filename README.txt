==========================================================================

The Freeseer project is a powerful software suite for capturing or
streaming video. 

It enables you to capture great presentations, demos, training material, 
and other videos. It handles desktop screen-casting with ease.
 
It is one of a few such tools that can also record vga output or video
from external sources such as firewire, usb, s-video, or rca.

It is particularly good at handling very large conferences with hundreds 
of talks and speakers using varied hardware and operating systems.

Freeseer itself can run on commodity hardware such as a laptop or desktop.
It is supported on Windows, and Linux, It will support MacOS soon.
 
Freeseer is written in Python, and uses Qt4 for its
GUI. It also uses Gstreamer for video/audio processing.

Freeseer is licensed under the GPL license, version 3.

Freeseer supports free (royalty free) audio and video codecs.

You can install Freeseer from binary packages. Visit our download site
if you would like to do so.

To develop and run freeseer, you require:
    Make, Git, Python 2.6, PyQT development tools, GStreamer
    
For Mac OSX, install:
---------------------
	install xcode from appstore
	install macport from www.macports.org
	notes:
		Currently apple_media is disabled by default on macports
		To enable it copy the ports folder into /Users/[USRNAME]/
		modify
		
	"sudo port install python27 gstreamer py27-gobject qt4-mac py27-pyqt4 
	py27-gst-python gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly 
	gst-plugins-bad +apple_media"
	YAPSY can be installed by "setup.py install"

For Fedora Linux, install:
--------------------------
    "sudo yum install git make PyQt4-devel python-feedparser.noarch python-setuptools"    

For Ubuntu Linux, install:
--------------------------
    "sudo apt-get install build-essential qt4-qmake pyqt4-dev-tools 
    libqt4-dev python-qt4 python-qt4-dev python2.6-dev python-feedparser"

For Windows, install: 
---------------------
    - python-2.7.2
    - GStreamer-WinBuilds-GPL-x86-Beta04-0.10.7
    - GStreamer-WinBuilds-SDK-GPL-x86-Beta04-0.10.7 
    - PyQt-Py2.7-x86-gpl-4.8.5-1
    - pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.0.win32-py2.7 
    - feedparser-5.0.1 
    - cmake-2.8.5-win32-x86
    - mingw-get-inst-20110802
    - setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7
    - yapsy
    
    Yapsy can be installed using easy_install that comes with setuptools using the command below.
    
    Run: C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\easy_install.py yapsy
    
    NOTES:
    	- Windows 32-bit packages are recommended when installing the above packages.
    	  This is because pygtk-all-in-one package at the time of this writing does
    	  not have a 64bit installer.
    	- The above software versions are known to work well. Python does need to be version 2.7.*

          On windows, add the following paths to your PATH variable:
          C:\Python26;C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\bin;C:\MinGW\bin
          
    Troubleshooting:
    	If you have issues running freeseer with cannot import gst error this link may help:
    	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6907473/cannot-import-gst-in-python

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have the prerequisite components, build freeseer by changing
directory into the freeseer directory (above src directory), and run:
    "mkdir build; cd build; cmake .."

    NOTE: If you are running on windows you will need an additional option
          for cmake to work. You can run 'cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..'

This will compile the gui files. Once this completes, you can then:
    "cd ../src"
    "./freeseer-record"

This starts up the Freeseer recording tool GUI.

If you would like to create packages, read PACKAGE.txt for instructions.

If you wish to capture vga input using epiphan's vga2usb device:
    first, copy the vga2usb.ko driver to /lib/modules/<kernel version>
    for the kernel you're running. Epiphan provides a list of pre-compiled
    drivers at http://epiphan.com

    Then, configure the driver:
    "sudo cp vga2usb.conf /etc/modprobe.d/; depmod -a"
